# Feature-Engineering-Applied-Data-Science
Designed and implemented feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for modelling, resulting in streamlined model training and improved predictive performance.
Perform the following steps:
1.	Understand the dataset:
a.	Identify the shape of the dataset
b.	Identify variables with null values
c.	Identify variables with unique values
2.	Generate a separate dataset for numerical and categorical variables
3.	EDA of numerical variables:
a.	Missing value treatment
b.	Identify the skewness and distribution
c.	Identify significant variables using a correlation matrix 
d.	Pair plot for distribution and density
4.	EDA of categorical variables
a.	Missing value treatment
b.	Count plot and box plot for bivariate analysis
c.	Identify significant variables using p-values and Chi-Square values
5.	Combine all the significant categorical and numerical variables
6.	Plot box plot for the new dataset to find the variables with outliers
Note: The last two points are performed to make the new dataset ready for training and prediction
